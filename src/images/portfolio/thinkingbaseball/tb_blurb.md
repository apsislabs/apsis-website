[Thinking Baseball](https://www.thinkingbaseball.com/) is a mobile app for iOS and Android designed to teach young players to master the mental side of baseball.

The application was built in three parts: a shared C# codebase for the game experience; native frontends for iOS and Android implemented in C# using the Xamarin SDK; and a Ruby on Rails web service for user authentication, permissions, e-commerce transactions, and licensing.

The mobile apps are available for free on the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/thinkingbaseball/id1221028028) and [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thinkingbaseball.app).
