bio: >
    Chris accidentally became a software developer when he realized
    how much he enjoyed his first programming class in college. He's
    never written a tetris clone in Q-Basic, and to date has never
    created a todo app or twitter clone. When he's not working he's
    most likely roasting coffee, brewing beer, or playing a board
    game.
