bio: >
    Niall is a cheerful curmudgeon and likes reading language and
    protocol specifications. He lives with his professorial wife
    and pint-sized daughter in Toronto, and is by default the head
    of the Canadian branch of Apsis. When he grows up he wants to
    be a farmer, or maybe a ballet dancer, or no, wait, a sailor!
